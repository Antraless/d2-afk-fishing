## How to use: 
1. [Download](https://github.com/Antraless/d2-afk-fishing/raw/main/fishing.exe) the script
2. Run the script (two extra files will be created: `e.png` and `fishinglog.txt`)
   * You may have to press "More info" and then "Run anyway" if you get the "Windows protected your PC" prompt
3. Open Destiny 2 and look in the top left
## Notes:
- Your interact keybind must be "E"
- Your D2 must be at your monitors resolution i.e. don't run D2 at 4k if your monitor is 1080p
- Your D2 cannot be in window mode "windowed"
- Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Antraless/d2-afk-fishing/blob/main/fishing.ahk). If you want to run the .ahk file, you will need to install [AHK 1.1](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-install.exe)
## Script Keybinds: 
- F4 to start fishing
- F3 to pause the script (to do public events, or whatever. If D2 is not active (you tab out), the script will pause itself)
- F2 to close the script
